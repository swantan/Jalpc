  desc: I received bioinformatics training during my undergraduate studies at National University of Malaysia (UKM) and earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Bioinformatics under the guidance of both Prof. Mohammad Asif Khan and late Prof. Thomas August of Johns Hopkins University. My MSc project focused on a bioinformatics approach to investigate the avian-to-human (A2H) mutation patterns of influenza A (H7N9) virus. Since then, my research interests have been gradually built towards infectious diseases, with great emphasis on influenza virus; and immunoinformatics applications (T cell epitope prediction). Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Georgia, co-supervised by Professor Annie De Groot, Professor Lenny Moise and Professor Justin Bahl to pursue my research career that are related to the translation of basic sciences into real life applications, especially in dealing with emerging infectious diseases.  # Describe yourself.
